        <h1> Software Development </h1>
        <p>I love to program computers as I believe it is the easiet way to build something. You don't need any materials, just a computer! I am capable of doing anything from embedded systems development, to frontend development. I have worked with many different lanuages and frameworks over the course of my life and I have enjoyed learning all of them.</p>
